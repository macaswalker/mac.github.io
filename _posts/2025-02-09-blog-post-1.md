I am currently playing Last Man Standing with my group of friends. I have thought that there should be a mathematical treatment of this problem - it seems as though there _should_ be an optimal way of playing.

In my exploration around this topic, I found [this](https://www.danialdervovic.com/2018/05/13/last-man-standing.html). This is a beautiful analysis and one I am super impressed by. There is, however, one main gripe I have with this treatment. The assumption of this model is that we should want to stay in _as long as possible_, as opposed to staying in _for the longest_. 

The Setup
=====

1. **Teams**  
   - Let there be $n$ teams in the league, labeled $1, 2, \dots, n$.
   - Each team $j$ plays a match in each gameweek (GW) $i$. We will ignore the case of double gameweeks.

2. **Players**  
   - Let there be $M$ players in the game.
   - Each player pays an entry fee of $x$ and aims to be the “last man standing.”

3. **States**  
   - After each week $i$, a player is either “alive” (if their chosen team that week won) or “eliminated” (if that team drew or lost).
   - A minimal representation of the **state** from an individual player’s perspective includes:
     - The current week index $i$.
     - The set of teams this player has **already used** in previous weeks.

4. **Actions**  
   - At the beginning of each week $i$, every **surviving** player must **choose** exactly one team $j$ that they have not chosen before.
   - If that chosen team $j$ **wins** its match in week $i$, the player survives to week $i+1$. Otherwise, the player is eliminated.

5. **Winning Probabilities**  
   - Let $p_j^{(i)}$ denote the probability that **team** $j$ wins its match in **week** $i$.

6. **States**
   - Let $a_j^{(i)}$ be the action of picking team $j$ at GW $i$. 

Hence we may visualise the entire game through the below graphic. Each node through this graph is a team, with winning and losing teams coloured green and red respectively. Each edge between a node is a choice of team $j$ at GW $i+1$ from GW $i$.

Hence, we want to successfully navigate through this graph, where after $k$ choices of team, only us remain. We wish our results to look like below:

# Optimal Strategy Formulation

In Last Man Standing, the objective is not merely to survive a given week, but to remain in the game longer than all the other players. The challenge is to choose teams over successive gameweeks so that your cumulative chance of never being eliminated is maximized.

## Mathematical Model

A player's strategy can be represented as a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$, where $\sigma(i)$ denotes the team chosen in gameweek $i$. Under the assumption that match outcomes are independent across gameweeks and teams, the probability of surviving the season with strategy $\sigma$ is:

$$
\operatorname{VAL}(\sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{\sigma(i)}^{(i)},
$$

where $p_j^{(i)}$ is the probability that team $j$ wins in GW $i$.

The optimal strategy is defined as:

$$
\sigma^* = \operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\sigma \in S_n} \, \operatorname{VAL}(\sigma).
$$

However, because the number of possible permutations is $n!$, finding $\sigma^*$ exactly is computationally intractable for large $n$.
