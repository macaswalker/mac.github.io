I am currently playing Last Man Standing with my group of friends. I have thought that there should be a mathematical treatment of this problem - it seems as though there _should_ be an optimal way of playing.

In my exploration around this topic, I found [this] (https://www.danialdervovic.com/2018/05/13/last-man-standing.html). This is a beautiful analysis and one I am super impressed by. There is, however, one main gripe I have with this treatment. The assumption of this model is that we should want to stay in _as long as possible_, as opposed to staying in _for the longest_.
