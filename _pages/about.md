This Website

This is primarily a portfolio website. That being said, I want to use it to talk about my work and start finally writing!

My Summary
======

I'm Mac, an MPhil student at the University of Cambridge, studying Biotechnology. I am a student researcher at the Milner Therapeutics Institute, where I am investigating multimodal Transformers for drug discovery in clear cell renal carcinoma (the most common form of kidney cancer). I am also a MARS researcher with the Cambridge AI safety hub, investigating circuit transplantation between Transformer models. I have previous experience in low-resolution, biologically inspired computer vision, at Opteran, and undergraduate research into geometry-preserving Gaussian Processes.
